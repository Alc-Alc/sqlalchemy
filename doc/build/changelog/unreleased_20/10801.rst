    :tickets: 10801, 10818

    Fixed regressions caused by typing added to the ``sqlalchemy.sql.functions``
    module in version 2.0.24, as part of :ticket:`6810`:

    * Further enhancements to pep-484 typing to allow SQL functions from
      :attr:`_sql.func` derived elements to work more effectively with ORM-mapped
      attributes (:ticket:`10801`)

    * Fixed the argument types passed to functions so that literal expressions
      like strings and ints are again interpreted correctly (:ticket:`10818`)
