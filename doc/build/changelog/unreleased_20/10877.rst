    Changed the default arraysize of the Oracle dialects so that the value set
    by the driver is used, that is 100 at the time of writing for both
    cx_oracle and oracledb. Previously the value was set to 50 by default. The
    setting of 50 could cause significant performance regressions compared to
    when using cx_oracle/oracledb alone to fetch many hundreds of rows over
    slower networks.
