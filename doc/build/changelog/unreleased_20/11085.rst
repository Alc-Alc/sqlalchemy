    Adjusted the fix made in :ticket:`10570`, released in 2.0.23, where new
    logic was added to reconcile possibly changing bound parameter values
    across cache key generations used within the :func:`_orm.with_expression`
    construct.  The new logic changes the approach by which the new bound
    parameter values are associated with the statement, avoiding the need to
    deep-copy the statement which can result in a significant performance
    penalty for very deep / complex SQL constructs.  The new approach no longer
    requires this deep-copy step.
