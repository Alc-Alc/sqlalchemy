    Ensured the use case of :class:`.Bundle` objects used in the
    ``returning()`` portion of ORM-enabled INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements
    is tested and works fully.   This was never explicitly implemented or
    tested previously and did not work correctly in the 1.4 series; in the 2.0
    series, ORM UPDATE/DELETE with WHERE criteria was missing an implementation
    method preventing :class:`.Bundle` objects from working.
