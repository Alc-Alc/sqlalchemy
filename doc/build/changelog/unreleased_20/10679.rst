    Added support for :ref:`oracledb` in asyncio mode, using the newly released
    version of the ``oracledb`` DBAPI that includes asyncio support. For the
    2.0 series, this is a preview release, where the current implementation
    does not yet have include support for
    :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncConnection.stream`. Improved support is planned for
    the 2.1 release of SQLAlchemy.
