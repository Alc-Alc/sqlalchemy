    Fixed issue where when making use of the
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.post_update` feature at the same time as using
    a mapper version_id_col could lead to a situation where the second UPDATE
    statement emitted by the post-update feature would fail to make use of the
    correct version identifier, assuming an UPDATE was already emitted in that
    flush which had already bumped the version counter.
