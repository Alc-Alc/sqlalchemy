    Added new core execution option
    :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.preserve_rowcount`. When
    set, the ``cursor.rowcount`` attribute from the DBAPI cursor will be
    unconditionally memoized at statement execution time, so that whatever
    value the DBAPI offers for any kind of statement will be available using
    the :attr:`_engine.CursorResult.rowcount` attribute from the
    :class:`_engine.CursorResult`.  This allows the rowcount to be accessed for
    statments such as INSERT and SELECT, to the degree supported by the DBAPI
    in use. The :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues` also supports this option and
    will ensure :attr:`_engine.CursorResult.rowcount` is correctly set for a
    bulk INSERT of rows when set.
